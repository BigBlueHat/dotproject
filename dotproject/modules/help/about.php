		<p><b>Version 0.2.1.5</b>
		
		<p><b>dotproject</b> is a PHP+MySQL beta level web based project management tool that dotmarketing started in Dec. 2000. It is about 70% along to where we think it should be.

		<p>While dotproject was specifically designed for dotmarketing's needs, it could probably be extremely useful for any sort of service agency that requires the ability to track a project to completion.

		<p>The current version of dotproject is .2, which reflects its immaturity fairly accurately. Still, we feel that there is a lot there that is much nicer than other "project management" systems, which seem to have the feel of "programmer only" projects.
