	* index.php: Added a check for missing modules.
	
	If an external module is installed and then its folder is deleted,

	error message. Now it is showing a Warning message, suggesting that
	the according module is probably missing.
	
	I wasn't sure if there was a proper warning page (maybe one as part
	of the public module) so I quickly made one up. If there is any
	standard for that, this should be changed to comply with it.

2004-06-04 09:47  uid1036151

	* locales/en/common.inc, modules/system/translate.php,
	modules/system/translate_save.php: Fixed the fact that we weren't
	erroring when a translation file pointer was bad (not writable, for
	instance). Fixed problem with slashes in the translations,
	especially noticable in the English common translation.

2004-06-04 08:52  uid1036151

	* includes/main_functions.php, modules/admin/vw_usr_perms.php,
	modules/public/selector.php: dPshowImage now center-aligns images
	to text Fixed problem in the selector as well as in user
	permissions where a company with ' in the name (ex. Jack's Bowling)
	would produce a JavaScript error because the string was unescaped.

2004-06-01 16:10  bloaterpaste

	* db/dotproject.sql, db/upgrade_latest.sql,
	modules/admin/vw_usr_perms.php, modules/system/system.class.php:
	Extended permissions system to support custom perms for modules. 
	Individual setup.php files can now include the following fields:
	$config['permissions_item_table'] = 'table_name'; ie companies
	$config['permissions_item_label'] = 'descriptive_field_name'; ie
	company_name $config['permissions_item_field'] = 'id_field'; ie
	company_id These are now stored, and can be referred to for pulling
	perms.	This will allow modules to utilize the currently table type
	currently supported by selector.php, companies, projects, tasks,
	files, departments, forums and users for permissions grant and
	revoke criteria.  modules table was modified to support this
	functionality.

2004-06-01 14:38  jcgonz

	of allocated hours per user

2004-05-27 13:47  robertoibarra

	* includes/: db_connect.php, main_functions.php: MAYOR update: this
	updates even my last update. Looking at more code and issues I
	found that international characters where marked to be saved as
	entities in the db, this overrides the concept of handling
	different locales and encodings so I returned it to the previous
	state where we use encodings to simplify international characters
	and maintain compatibility with all the language locales all ready
	working.

2004-05-27 12:53  robertoibarra

	* includes/db_connect.php: UTF-8 locales didn't save in the

	* modules/projects/index.php: Changed company filter to be
	Company/Department filter.  In conjunction to my
	contact/deptartment tables that I just checked in, this will allow
	a user to winnow projects down by the department(s) they are
	assigned to.  The company drop down now lists all companies and
	departments.

2004-05-19 14:57  bloaterpaste

	* db/dotproject.sql, db/upgrade_latest.sql,
	modules/projects/projects.class.php, modules/tasks/tasks.class.php:
	Added project_departments, project_contacts, task_departments and
	task_contacts tables to store relational data about those
	relationships.	This does not (at this time) replace the use of the
	text fields of the same use for tasks and departments.	This is
	meant to be an interrum step.  But, this will allow better
	reporting and filtering capabilities throughout the application. 
	PENDING: upgrade task that will fully populate those four tables
	based on existing data.  I'll write this as soon and I know where
	to put it.  If anyone knows where to put a chunk of PHP to be
	executed on upgrade, please let me know.  For now this change will
	just affect all projects and tasks edited or created after the
	point of upgrade.
	
	Added new store() function in the project.class.php file.

2004-05-17 16:26  bloaterpaste

	* modules/: calendar/calendar.class.php, public/calendar.php: The

	popup.	So, if a user had previously clicked on the 10th on the
	selector, when he/she comes back later and clicks that same popup,
	the 10th will be highlighted.
	
	Also added to the calendar.class.php the ability to highlight as
	many days as someone might want by populating it's highlightedDays
	arrays with name value pairs of dates (20040517) and the hex color

	modules/projects/projects.class.php, modules/projects/view.php:
	Adding project_departments and project_contacts fields to the
	projects table to support department and contact association with 
	projects.  This isn't the right way to implement this association,
	but it's the way that's currently used in tasks, so should be fine
	for now.  At some point, we should build seperate db table for
	handle this association, like the task->user association is
	currently handled.
	
	Added UI support for selection and display of contact and
	department information.

	size="10"";} A new text box will be displayed for input with the
	leyend quote number in the tasks module.
	
	Companies and Contacts are now linked by the company name (in
	text).	They are not linked by ID so that contacts don't have to
	have companies registered in the Companies section so it maintains
	backwards compatibility.  New department field added please check
	the upgrade SQL file. Department can be linked to the Company
	department by text also.  Dotproject now has some mini CRM
	features!
	
	Now users can relate departments to tasks.

	for english language from iso-8859-1 to utf-8. It really doesn't
	affect anybody using the english locale and typing everything in

	users create a new language and had been using the english locale
	they get screwed up characters in text fields becase of using the

	modules/projects/reports/userperformance.php,
	modules/tasks/addedit.php, modules/tasks/tasks.class.php,
	modules/tasks/view.php: WARNING!!!!!!! Dynamic tasks have been
	implemented. This will cause weird behavior if the concept is not
	understood. A dynamic task is a task that gets its properties from
	its children like hours and dates, it functions like a GROUP of
	child tasks. It won't matter what you put in those fields in them
	since when you save them or save their children, the parent dynamic
	tasks will be updated. If you don't care about this feature please
	change your tasks to not being dynamic (the defaults have been
	changed for new tasks to not be dynamic), otherwise enjoy this
	feature any project manager should have. Technically, the
	previously unused task_hours_worked field is now used to save the
	dynamic tasks duration.
