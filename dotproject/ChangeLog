modules/calendar/vw_day_events.php

2004-06-04 15:47  (uid1036151)
---------------------------------
locales/en/common.inc
modules/system/translate.php
modules/system/translate_save.php
- Fixed the fact that we weren't erroring when a translation file pointer was
- bad (not writable, for instance). Fixed problem with slashes in the
- translations, especially noticable in the English common translation.

2004-06-04 14:52  (uid1036151)
---------------------------------
includes/main_functions.php
modules/admin/vw_usr_perms.php
modules/public/selector.php
- dPshowImage now center-aligns images to text
- Fixed problem in the selector as well as in user permissions where a
- company with ' in the name (ex. Jack's Bowling) would produce a JavaScript
- error because the string was unescaped.

---------------------------------
db/dotproject.sql
db/upgrade_latest.sql
modules/admin/vw_usr_perms.php
modules/system/system.class.php
- Extended permissions system to support custom perms for modules.  Individual setup.php files can now include the following fields:
- $config['permissions_item_table'] = 'table_name'; ie companies
- $config['permissions_item_label'] = 'descriptive_field_name'; ie company_name
- $config['permissions_item_field'] = 'id_field'; ie company_id
- These are now stored, and can be referred to for pulling perms.  This will allow modules to utilize the currently table type currently supported by selector.php, companies, projects, tasks, files, departments, forums and users for permissions grant and revoke criteria.  modules table was modified to support this functionality.

2004-06-01 20:38  (jcgonz)
---------------------------------
modules/projects/reports/allocateduserhours.php
- Added total sum of allocated hours per user

2004-05-27 19:47  (robertoibarra)
---------------------------------
includes/db_connect.php
includes/main_functions.php
- MAYOR update: this updates even my last update. Looking at more code and issues I found that international characters where marked to be saved as entities in the db, this overrides the concept of handling different locales and encodings so I returned it to the previous state where we use encodings to simplify international characters and maintain compatibility with all the language locales all ready working.

2004-05-27 18:53  (robertoibarra)
---------------------------------
includes/db_connect.php
- UTF-8 locales didn't save in the database correctly, fixed by adding the locale_char_set parameter to the htmlentities function that created the sql

2004-05-20 20:35  (bloaterpaste)

2004-05-20 20:28  (bloaterpaste)
---------------------------------

- Moving tasks will now move all of the children tasks as well.

2004-05-20 02:32  (bloaterpaste)
---------------------------------
modules/tasks/addedit.php

2004-05-19 23:36  (bloaterpaste)
---------------------------------
modules/projects/index.php
- Changed company filter to be Company/Department filter.  In conjunction to my contact/deptartment tables that I just checked in, this will allow a user to winnow projects down by the department(s) they are assigned to.  The company drop down now lists all companies and departments.

2004-05-19 20:57  (bloaterpaste)
---------------------------------
db/dotproject.sql
db/upgrade_latest.sql
modules/projects/projects.class.php
modules/tasks/tasks.class.php
- Added project_departments, project_contacts, task_departments and task_contacts tables to store relational data about those relationships.  This does not (at this time) replace the use of the text fields of the same use for tasks and departments.  This is meant to be an interrum step.  But, this will allow better reporting and filtering capabilities throughout the application.  PENDING: upgrade task that will fully populate those four tables based on existing data.  I'll write this as soon and I know where to put it.  If anyone knows where to put a chunk of PHP to be executed on upgrade, please let me know.  For now this change will just affect all projects and tasks edited or created after the point of upgrade.
- 
- Added new store() function in the project.class.php file.

2004-05-17 22:26  (bloaterpaste)
---------------------------------
modules/calendar/calendar.class.php
modules/public/calendar.php
- The currently selected date will now be highlighted on the calendar popup.  So, if a user had previously clicked on the 10th on the selector, when he/she comes back later and clicks that same popup, the 10th will be highlighted.
- 
- Also added to the calendar.class.php the ability to highlight as many days as someone might want by populating it's highlightedDays arrays with name value pairs of dates (20040517) and the hex color for the highlight (#FF0000).

- Adding project_departments and project_contacts fields to the projects table to support department and contact association with  projects.  This isn't the right way to implement this association, but it's the way that's currently used in tasks, so should be fine for now.  At some point, we should build seperate db table for handle this association, like the task->user association is currently handled.

Dependant tasks, (not dynamic), now have their dates automatically adjusted when the end date of the task they are dependant on changes. It also changes the getAllowedRecords and getDeniedrecords in the projects class to not allow access to projects that are under companies that are denied.
